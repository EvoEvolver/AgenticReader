  "question": "Give a list of label\tAbsorption max (nm)\tEmission max (nm)\tLifetime (ns)\tQuantum yield for the compounds mentioned in the document.",
  "answer": "Document overview\n- Topic: Solvatochromic and photophysical behavior of three 3-[2-(4-aminophenyl)benzoxazol-5-yl]alanine derivatives across many solvents; nitrogen substituent controls properties.\n- Compounds: At least compounds 1–3 are explicitly studied; compound 4 is discussed later. Full UV/Vis–fluorescence datasets are provided in the main text for compound 1 (Table 1) and in the ESI for compounds 2–3 (Tables 1S–2S).\n- Where the requested data live:\n  - Compound 1: “Table 1 UV/Vis spectroscopic and photophysical properties of 1 in 35 solvents” (main text; image tables).\n  - Compound 2 and 3: raw solvent-by-solvent data referenced as Table 1S and Table 2S in the ESI (not embedded as text in the main document).\n  - Figures 2–3 show spectra in six selected solvents for compound 1.\n\nWhat I’ve found so far\n- I located and parsed Table 1 (image) for compound 1 and extracted, per solvent, the absorption maximum (nm), emission maximum (nm), fluorescence lifetime (ns), and quantum yield (ΦF).\n\nCompound 1 — per-solvent list: label (solvent), Absorption max (nm), Emission max (nm), Lifetime (ns), Quantum yield\n(Source: Table 1 images in the article: https://storage.treer.ai/images/74a105ce63cf9de925a777f326b9d3f9e9cad576937c35e0582b9f9d5a20a7e7.jpg and https://storage.treer.ai/images/a34fe19e58c17a4085a78bdb176ab68761fa8ed6eb59999e22ff1df4dc3c6171.jpg)\n\n- Methanol — 350.2 nm; 535.3 nm; 0.76 ns; 0.03\n- Ethanol — 350.5 nm; 520.0 nm; 1.59 ns; 0.07\n- 1-Butanol — 351.5 nm; 488.1 nm; 3.97 ns; 0.18\n- 2-Methylpropan-1-ol — 350.4 nm; 488.4 nm; 4.24 ns; 0.20\n- 2-Propanol — 349.0 nm; 495.0 nm; 4.41 ns; 0.19\n- 1-Pentanol — 347.6 nm; 454.5 nm; 5.44 ns; 0.28\n- 1-Hexanol — 351.5 nm; 483.9 nm; 4.64 ns; 0.22\n- 1-Cyclohexanol — 352.5 nm; 492.9 nm; 4.88 ns; 0.18\n- 1-Heptanol — 351.3 nm; 482.5 nm; 4.34 ns; 0.21\n- Ethane-1,2-diol — 355.6 nm; 516.9 nm; 0.41 ns; 0.03\n- Propane-1,2-diol — 354.1 nm; 492.6 nm; 0.88 ns; 0.11\n- Formamide — 354.9 nm; 429.8 nm; 2.35 ns; 0.02\n- Acetone — 349.0 nm; 496.5 nm; 5.11 ns; 0.19\n- Acetonitrile — 347.2 nm; 515.6 nm; 2.40 ns; 0.11\n- Trichloromethane — 352.5 nm; 447.8 nm; 4.71 ns; 0.58\n- Dichloromethane — 350.6 nm; 476.3 nm; 6.11 ns; 0.45\n- n-Pentane — 339.6 nm; 402.0 nm; 1.88 ns; 1.00\n- 3-Methylpentane — 340.0 nm; 402.0 nm; 1.67 ns; 0.97\n- Cyclohexane — 342.5 nm; 405.0 nm; 1.81 ns; 0.98\n- n-Hexane — 341.0 nm; 402.4 nm; 1.66 ns; 1.00\n- 2,2,4-Trimethylpentane — 340.8 nm; 403.1 nm; 1.70 ns; 1.00\n- n-Nonane — 341.7 nm; 404.6 nm; 1.78 ns; 0.95\n- n-Decane — 341.7 nm; 404.6 nm; 1.79 ns; 1.00\n- 1,2-Dimethoxyethane — 349.3 nm; 497.5 nm; 1.18 ns; 0.07\n- 1,4-Dioxane — 348.2 nm; 441.0 nm; 4.14 ns; 0.73\n- Tetrahydrofuran — 348.1 nm; 470.9 nm; 5.29 ns; 0.27\n- 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran — 347.3 nm; 441.6 nm; 4.37 ns; 0.52\n- Diethyl ether — 344.2 nm; 442.6 nm; 4.40 ns; 0.60\n- 4-Methyl-1,3-dioxolan-2-one — 350.6 nm; 517.5 nm; 4.30 ns; 0.11\n- Benzene — 350.0 nm; 420.3 nm; 2.97 ns; 0.76\n- Toluene — 349.0 nm; 419.4 nm; 2.81 ns; 0.78\n- 1,2-Dimethylbenzene — 349.2 nm; 418.2 nm; 2.70 ns; 0.84\n- Ethyl acetate — 345.6 nm; 454.8 nm; 4.68 ns; 0.39\n- N,N-Dimethylformamide — 351.9 nm; 516.1 nm; 5.10 ns; 0.16\n- Dimethyl sulfoxide — 354.5 nm; 526.0 nm; 4.74 ns; 0.15\n\nNotes\n- Where multi-exponential lifetimes are reported, the table usually highlights the dominant component; the values above follow the table’s main (largest-amplitude) lifetime per solvent.\n- For compounds 2 and 3, the solvent-resolved tables are in the ESI (Table 1S and Table 2S) referenced in the article text (e.g., “Fig. 1S and 2S, Table 1S, ESI” and “Fig. 3S and 4S, Table 2S, ESI”). If you can share those ESI tables or images, I can extract the same fields for compounds 2 and 3 as well.\n\nNext steps\n- Do you want this exported as a CSV?\n- If you provide the ESI (Tables 1S and 2S) or their images, I’ll parse absorption max, emission max, lifetime, and quantum yield for compounds 2 and 3 to complete the list for all compounds mentioned."
