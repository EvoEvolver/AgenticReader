The systems exhibit intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states (of variable ICT character strengths) leading to fluorescence emission ranging from deep blue to green with moderate to high photoluminescence quantum yields. The emission properties can be effectively tuned by systematically changing the position of substitution on both donor and acceptor units (which affects the extent of conjugation) and the redox potentials of the donor units. The results are supported by cyclic voltammetric data and TD-DFT calculations.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe development of conjugated organic materials for optoelectronic devices remains a key objective across many disciplines of science.1 These materials have applications in organic/polymeric light-emitting diodes (O/PLEDs),2 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),3 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),4 electrochromism, and sensors.6 Studies on π\\\\piπ conjugated oligomers provide valuable insights into relevant fundamental properties.7\n\nThe covalent combination of electron donor and electron acceptor units has provided a wealth of information about energy and charge transfer processes.8 For example, the luminescence of 9,9-dialkylfluorene copolymers9 can be tuned over a large wavelength range by utilizing intramolecular\n\n# JOC Article\n\nCHaRT 1\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/995ed7361bc960f79feb22e8e26d8e0b7a01cef2662109b9e9474d28a058be3b.jpg)\n\ncharge and energy transfer processes both in solution and in the solid state.10 Oligo-/polycarbazoles are also a benchmark family of materials which are widely used for O/PLEDs, OFETs, and OPVs.11 They are predominantly hole transporters (p type) with reversible redox properties, strong luminescence, and a larger band gap than for polyfluorenes. Similarly, arylamines are well documented, mainly due to their high holetransporting ability.12 Many optoelectronic applications require ambipolar compounds: i.e., those able to accept, transport, or store both holes and electrons.1315 Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes16 often play an important role in the photophysics of ambipolar systems. For example, Kulkarni et al. demonstrated an increase in ICT emission upon increasing the strength of the donor unit, comparing N.N .N. -methylcarbazole with the stronger donor N.N .N. -methylphenothiazine in acceptor— donor—acceptor trimers (acceptor \\=\\=\\= phenylquinoline).17Estrada and Neckers studied fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile derivatives as strong acceptors, linked through the 2,7- or 3,6-positions via alkyne bridges to carbazole donors to provide donor— acceptor—donor triads.18 Effective electronic communication was observed through the 3,6-positions to the fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile core. However, in contrast with the donor— acceptor—donor systems described in the present article, the ICT state in these fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile derivatives was a nonradiative deactivation pathway (i.e., nonemissive), with one of the 3,6-disubstituted oligomers showing total emission quenching in polar solvents.\n\nOur group19 and other workers20 have incorporated dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (S) as an electron-deficient comonomer unit in oligo-/polyfluorene (F) backbones, e.g. trimer 119a\\\\mathbf { 1 } ^ { 1 9 \\\\mathrm { a } }119a and polymer 219d2 ^ { \\\\mathrm { 1 9 d } }219d (Chart 1), which show high luminescence efficiency. DFT calculations and cyclic voltammetric data established that the lower energy LUMO levels of the sulfone unit enhance the electron-accepting properties of 1 and 2.\n\nIn solution, F−S\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S }F−S co-oligomers and copolymers of type 1 and 2 show a degree of intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character and excited state relaxation depending on the nature of the local environment,: e.g. the solvent polarity.1 19b,c In nonpolar solvents, such as hexane or toluene, a well-structured emission is observed, in agreement with minimal conformation and solvent relaxations following excitation, whereas in polar solvents, such as acetonitrile, ethanol, and chloroform, broad, featureless (and red-shifted) ICT emission is dominant. The stability of the ICT state in F−S\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S }F−S co-oligomers and copolymers is reduced by more twisted backbone conformations enforced by substituent effects on the S units.21 Ambipolar molecules comprising disubstituted S units as the acceptor moiety and diphenylamine/triphenylamine donor moieties have also been studied.22\n\nThe present work describes new ambipolar oligomers containing S as the core unit. The objective is to tune the emission properties by combining the strategies of conjugation control (by systematically changing the substitution pattern between donor and acceptor) and varying the redox potential of the donor unit: namely, carbazole Π(CZ)\\\\mathbf { \\\\Pi } ( \\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { Z } )Π(CZ) , di-/triphenylamine (DPA, TPA), and fluorene (F).\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/02dbdc8d025fc625ea9003ba7aaefbc4efd473fdfb775aca552511c88b7e39e1.jpg)  \nSCHEME 1.

The carbazole boronic acid derivatives 5 and 14 were synthesized in good yields from 4 and 13, respectively, by a sequence of lithiation, borylation, and hydrolysis. The 2-ethylhexyl substituent was chosen to enhance solubility. For the cross-couplings dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium(II) or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) was used as a catalyst and trimers 8, 9, 11, 15, 17, and 18 were obtained in moderate to good yields as either white or yellow solids. N-substituted carbazole trimers 20 and 21 were synthesized via palladium-catalyzed C−N\\\\mathrm { C - N }C−N cross-coupling reactions of carbazole 19 with 6 and 10, respectively (Scheme 4). The very low solubility of 20 and 21 made reaction and workup difficult, and the products were obtained in low yields. The diarylamine analogue 23 was similarly synthesized from 6. The triarylamine analogue 26 was synthesized by a different route. The diboronic ester derivative 24 underwent Suzuki cross-coupling (Scheme 5) with 25 to give 26. Both 23 and 26 are bright yellow solids with good solubility imparted by the nnn -butyl substituents.\n\nCyclic voltammetric data on all the CZ−S−CZ\\\\mathbf { C \\_ { Z } } \\\\mathbf { - S } \\\\mathbf { - C \\_ { Z } }CZ​−S−CZ​ DPA−S−\\\\mathrm { \\\\bf D P A - S - }DPA−S− DPA, TPA-S-TPA, and F−S−F\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S } { - } \\\\mathbf { F }F−S−F trimers synthesized here are given in Table 1. The carbazolyl derivatives show irreversible oxidation waves at ca. 0.8−1.0V0 . 8 \\\\mathrm { - } 1 . 0 \\\\mathrm { V }0.8−1.0V typically found for carbazoles.23 These potentials are lower than those of the reversible oxidation waves observed at ca. 1.2−1.4 :V1 . 2 { - } 1 . 4 \\\\ : \\\\mathrm { V }1.2−1.4 :V for the fluorenyl analogues. Even lower oxidation potentials at ca. 0.4V0 . 4 \\\\mathrm { V }0.4V were obtained for the DPA (23) and TPA compounds (26), demonstrating a decrease in oxidation potential with an increase in donor strength (fluorene carbazole arylamine). While trimer 26 showed a reversible two-electron oxidation wave, indicating that oxidizing one amine group has little influence on the oxidation of the second amine group, trimer 23 showed two well-separated one-electron reversible waves ΔE\\=300mV\\\\Delta E = 3 0 0 \\\\mathrm { m V }ΔE\\=300mV ), implying that oxidation at one amine group strongly influences the oxidation of the second amine group. These waves suggest that substantial conjugation exists across the linear S unit. The reduction potentials observed for the reversible waves of these trimers are within the range of ca. −1.9\\- 1 . 9−1.9 to −2.4V\\- 2 . 4 \\\\mathrm { V }−2.4V and arise from the one-electron reduction of the S unit in all cases.

There is a progressive red shift in the absorption and emission in the series fluorene → carbazole → arylamine, in line with the increasing electron-donating ability of these substituents: e.g., λPL\\\\lambda \\_ { \\\\mathrm { P L } }λPL​ (CHCl3)\\\\mathrm { ( C H C l \\_ { 3 } ) }(CHCl3​) 1 at 427 nm4 2 7 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }427 nm , 2.90 eV2 . 9 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { e V }2.90 eV ,8 at 458 nm4 5 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }458 nm , 2.71eV2 . 7 1 \\\\mathrm { e V }2.71eV , and 26 at 520nm5 2 0 \\\\mathrm { n m }520nm , 2.38 :eV2 . 3 8 \\\\ : \\\\mathrm { e V }2.38 :eV (Figure 1).

Thus, the fluorene-containing trimers exhibit deep blue fluorescence which becomes sky blue for the carbazole analogues and green for the arylamine analogues (see Figure SI2-8 in the Supporting Information for a photograph showing the emission colors of compounds 1, 8, and 23). The TPA-based trimer 26 emits at the longest wavelength of all the compounds in this study (in both toluene and chloroform), consistent with the stronger donor enhancing the red shift.\n\nAll the oligomers show positive solvatochromism in their photoluminescence (PL) spectra due to ICT behavior, which enables the emission color to be tuned by varying the solvent polarity. Table 2 shows the absorption and emission data in both toluene and chloroform for all compounds. Compounds 20 and 21 are distinct in that they are bonded directly through the carbazole N atom rather than via one of the ring carbons and are considerably less soluble than the other trimers discussed here.\n\nTable 3 gives the Stokes and solvatochromic shift energies. There appear to be two distinct groups in this study based on the ICT character of these trimers. Trimers with relatively strong ICT may be defined by\n\n(i) a lack of fine structure emission in toluene (only one band value given in Table 2)  \n(ii) a large positive solvatochromic shift in the emission band on changing from toluene to chloroform (\\>1000 cm−1( > 1 0 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }(\\>1000 cm−1 in Table 3)  \n(iii) a significantly positive solvatochromatic shift in the low-energy absorption maximum from toluene to chloroform (\\>400 c^m−1( { > } 4 0 0 \\\\ \\\\mathrm { \\\\hat { c } m } ^ { - 1 }(\\>400 c^m−1 in Table 3)  \n(iv) larger Stokes shifts (5000−6000 cm−1,( 5 0 0 0 { - } 6 0 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ,(5000−6000 cm−1, in both toluene and chloroform\n\nTrimers with relatively weak ICT character may, therefore, be defined by\n\n(i) the presence of fine structure emission in toluene (two band values given in Table 2)\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/6ffec8df1de70ef541a08e508942c77315f96ccfbefe901c147676990eb7310f.jpg)  \nSCHEME 5.

The linear compounds containing DPA and TPA units (23 and 26, respectively) are between. The CT strength may be measured by comparing the emission peak maxima in different solvents: compound 11 represents strong ICT character, whereas the previously reported compound 1 is representative of weak ICT character (for details of the solvatochromism of 1 see ref 19b). Solvatochromic effects were studied in detail for compound 11, and Figure 2 shows the emission spectra in eight solvents of different polarities (see Figure SI2-19 for the corresponding absorption spectra). Figure 3 depicts the emission colors of 11 in four solvents.\n\nFor compound 11 spectral shifts due to solvent polarity are seen in both the absorption and emission spectra, with a profound effect seen in the emission. The emission spectra are red-shifted and broadened as the solvent polarity increases (from MCH to methanol), typical of ICT excited as. can be seen in MCH but disappears as the solvent polarity increases, again indicative of an excited ICT state.26\n\nBy plotting the wavelengths of the emission maxima of 11 in the different solvents as a function of the solvent orientation polarizability, Δf\\=(ε−1)/(2ε+1)−1/2((n2−1)/(2n2+1))\\\\Delta f = ( \\\\varepsilon - 1 ) / ( 2 \\\\varepsilon + 1 ) - 1 / 2 ( ( n ^ { 2 } - 1 ) / ( 2 n ^ { 2 } + 1 ) )Δf\\=(ε−1)/(2ε+1)−1/2((n2−1)/(2n2+1)) (LppMat eutn), thdit plt is obtained (Figure 4). It can be seen from this plot that the spectral shift of the emission follows (to a good approximation) a linear trend. Polar aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane and acetonitrile which are included in this plot indicate that the spectral shift is the result of solvent polarity and is not due to hydrogen bonding. Figure 4 also shows the Lippert plot of 1 for comparison (data taken from ref 19b). The slope of the Lippert plots of both 1 and 11 suggests, as can be seen from the Lippert— Mataga equation, that the excited-state dipole moment is larger than the ground-state dipole moment, which is also confirmed by the transient spectral shift to lower energies, observed in polar media from time-resolved data (as discussed in ref 19b). Especially for 11 the slope is much steeper, which, assuming that the cavity radii are similar for both compounds, yields a much larger difference between the dipole moments of the excited and ground states. This suggests a large charge separation for 11 in the excited state, which is also compatible with the frontier orbital picture obtained through DFT calculations (vide infra, Figure 8).\n\nTABLE 2.

Lippert plots for 1 and 11.\n\nChanging the position of the donor substituents on the S unit significantly affects the absorption and emission spectra. For 11 (2,8-disubstitution: bent) compared to isomer 8 (3,7-disubstitution: linear), the emission is blue-shifted (Figure 5). This can be explained by extended conjugative (para) effects in 8 where four rings are in conjugation, whereas in 11 only two rings are in conjugation. This effect is also seen in the analogous F−S\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S }F−S systems 1 and 18. However, the bent vs linear effects of the N.N .N. -carbazole groups on the emission maxima in 20 and 21 (Figure 6) are much smaller, implying that less conjugation is taking place between the carbazolyl groups and the S unit in the linear isomer.\n\nAnalogous 2,8-disubstituted (bent) S units with both DPA and TPA substituents (without butyl chains) have been previously reported;22 they exhibit blue-shifted emission in toluene compared with 23 and 26, indicating similar bent vs linear effects. A similar effect was reported by Estrada and Neckers for trimers with the fluoren-9-ylidene malonitrile acceptor at the core: for the linear trimer the HOMO was delocalized, whereas for the bent isomer the HOMO was predominantly localized on the donor units.18\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/aa1975136061c9a5e12ff01fe20646d93121d6317c1805a44afc222d119f302f.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5.

Absorption and emission spectra for 20 and 21 showing the solvent effects on the maxima values. Bent vs linear conformations have little effect on the emission maxima values.\n\nAs we were completing this paper, Grisorio et al. reported the NNN -methylcarbazole analogues of 8 and 11.28 Due to limited solubility they were unable to study the solvatochromism of these compounds, as we have done for 8 and 11. Their observation that substitution of S in the 2,8-position gave more blue-shifted emission in chloroform due to a reduced conjugation effect, in comparison to the 3,7-isomer, is consistent with our data discussed above for 8 and 11.\n\nA general trend is that the bent systems have lower fluorescence quantum yields compared to their linear isomers: compare 1 and 18, 8 and 11, and 20 and 21 (i.e. linear versus bent, respectively). The addition of the fluorine substituents increases the quantum yields ΦPL\\\\Phi \\_ { \\\\mathrm { P L } }ΦPL​ from 0.45 to 0.58(±0.05)0 . 5 8 \\\\left( \\\\pm 0 . 0 5 \\\\right)0.58(±0.05) , on comparing 8 and 9 in toluene, presumably due to a decrease in nonradiative decay pathways caused by C−H\\\\mathrm { C - H }C−H bond vibrations.29 A similar effect is observed for the analogous F−S\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S }F−S systems 1 and 17.21c\n\nAll time-resolved fluorescence decays could be fitted with two exponential components whose amplitudes and time constants, are given in Table 4, along with the average lifetime, the values of excitation and collection wavelengths, the solvent, and the local χ2\\\\chi ^ { 2 }χ2 values of the fitting in each case. The average lifetime was calculated from the expression30 τav\\=∑iAiτi2/∑iAiτi,\\\\begin{array} { r } { \\\\tau \\_ { \\\\mathrm { a v } } = \\\\sum \\_ { i } A \\_ { i } \\\\tau \\_ { i } ^ { 2 } / \\\\sum \\_ { i } A \\_ { i } \\\\tau \\_ { i } , } \\\\end{array}τav​\\=∑i​Ai​τi2​/∑i​Ai​τi​,​ where aia \\_ { i }ai​ and τi\\\\tau \\_ { i }τi​ are the amplitude and time constant of each exponential, respectively, and τav\\\\tau \\_ { \\\\mathrm { a v } }τav​ is the average lifetime. For all toluene solutions, except for 1 (see the previous discussion for this compound),19c both components have positive amplitudes with the fast components having time constants in the range of hundreds of picoseconds and the slower components having time constants in the range of nanoseconds.\n\nThe pre-exponential amplitude associated with the faster component is always small, and the weight of this decay component is always below 2%2 \\\\%2% , in agreement with the very small transient spectral relaxation observed in toluene, a low-polarity solvent. For compound 11, and also for compound 1,19b aditional time-resolved measurements were performed in ethanol, which is a solvent of high polarity (Figure 7). The decays collected in the high-energy region of the spectrum could be fitted with two exponential components with positive amplitudes. One component appears as a fast decay with a time constant of 28 ps2 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { p s }28 ps ,while the slower component has a time constant of 3.98 ns3 . 9 8 \\\\mathrm { \\\\ n s }3.98 ns The decays collected in the low-energy part of the spectrum could be fitted again with two exponential components. However, the amplitude of the fast one is now negative and its time constant is 23 ps, which correlates well with the time constant of the corresponding fast component of the high-energy region of the spectrum. The latter observation is a good indication that these components are due to the excited-state reorganization, controlled by solvent and molecular rearrangements, as observed for compound 1.19b The time constant of the slow component (3.93 ns) is also in excellent agreement with the corresponding one in the high-energy region of the spectrum. This indicates that the slow component is associated with the lifetime of the ICT state of this compound (11) in ethanol.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/fe49975cf665694939396c59e7d62ab4af4bd583c220cb3f332cebad1a608af4.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.

Methyl groups were used instead of ethylhexyl or butyl groups (where present) to reduce computational efforts, and these model geometries are labeled with \"a\" for convenience. Many conformers were found, but no true minimum for a planar geometry was located in any trimer. Only the most stable conformers found are considered here, and their dihedral angles are listed in Table 5. Comparison of the geometrical parameters between the optimized model geometry 17a and the experimental mty ynt.T angles between the F and S units are 40.2∘4 0 . 2 ^ { \\\\circ }40.2∘ in 17a\\\\mathbf { 1 7 a }17a (theory) and between 36.7 and 46.0∘4 6 . 0 ^ { \\\\circ }46.0∘ in 17 (experimental).\n\nPlanar geometries were optimized using C2νC \\_ { 2 \\\\nu }C2ν​ symmetry constraints (apart from 23a and 26a, where the tolyl groups at nitrogen would be unrealistically constrained to be perpendicular to the S unit) to obtain differences in energy between the planar and nonplanar geometries. These energy values are given in Table 5 and would be considered as rotational energy barriers to planar geometries. For the vast majority of the trimers, the energy barriers are in the range of only 4.0−5.5kcalmol−14 . 0 { - } 5 . 5 \\\\mathrm { k c a l m o l } ^ { - 1 }4.0−5.5kcalmol−1 .The donor and acceptor units are considered to be freely rotating in solution at ambient temperatures.

Planar geometries of 20a and 21a are unlikely to be present in solution at ambient temperatures, as hydrogens near the carbazolyl nitrogen severely hinder such planar geometries.\n\nThe singlet excited-state geometries (S1) were also optimized without symmetry constraints and, like the ground-state geometries (S0)\\\\mathrm { ( S \\_ { 0 } ) }(S0​) , nonplanar geometries were located as minima. The dihedral angles are smaller by 5−17∘5 - 1 7 ^ { \\\\circ }5−17∘ in all cases, except for 20a, 21a, and 23a\\\\mathbf { 2 3 a }23a , where the angles are larger due to unfavorable steric factors involving the N.N .N. carbazolyl and DPA units. The S1\\\\mathrm { S } \\_ { 1 }S1​ planar geometries were also obtained using C2νC \\_ { 2 \\\\nu }C2ν​ symmetry constraints and reveal slightly smaller energy barriers to planar forms in comparison to the ground-state geometries. The differences in the dihedral angles of 6.6−6.8∘6 . 6 { - } 6 . 8 ^ { \\\\circ }6.6−6.8∘ due to the fluorine atoms in 9 and 17 compared to 8 and 1 in the S1\\\\mathrm { S } \\_ { 1 }S1​ excited-state geometries indicate steric effects with the fluorine atoms but, as shown in their photophysical data and the small energy barriers to planar forms, these steric effects are not significant.\n\nMolecular orbital calculations on the S0\\\\mathrm { S } \\_ { 0 }S0​ optimized geometries of the model trimers show that the HOMOs are located on the donor groups and LUMO on the S unit, in accord with observed CV and photophysical data. The delocalized LUMOs suggest that the thiophene S,S-dioxide ring (rather than only the SO2\\\\mathrm { S O } \\_ { 2 }SO2​ unit) acts as the acceptor. The HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) energies are compared with the CV data in Table 1, where trends are clearly evident. The different absolute values are typical when comparing oxidation and reduction potentials with computed MO energies. The calculated HOMO energies correspond to the increasing electron-donating ability of the donor unit from fluorenyl (F) to carbazolyl τ(CZ)\\\\mathbf { \\\\tau } ( \\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { Z } )τ(CZ) to arylamine groups (DPA, TPA). The calculated LUMO and HLG energies are also in broad agreement with observed reduction potentials and HLGs in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 6.

When the linear and bent analogues of 8a and 11a are compared, it is clear that the HOMO and LUMO characters are more localized on the donor and acceptor units, respectively, for the bent isomers. These frontier orbitals are shown pictorially in Figure 8, where the HOMO and LUMO are considered as largely π\\\\piπ (donor) and π∗\\\\pi ^ { \\* }π∗ (acceptor) orbitals, respectively, with more mixing in both orbitals for 8a. Similar conclusions are found for the linear/bent pair, 1a and 18a. A slightly different scenario occurs for 20a and 21a, where the HOMO and LUMO compositions are similar in both cases and are essentially localized (Figure 9). This indicates that the conjugation present in other linear trimers is reduced in compound 20a, due to significantly nonplanar orientations of the carbazolyl groups in 20a.\n\nTD-DFT computations were carried out on the S0\\\\mathrm { S } \\_ { 0 }S0​ model geometries to assign the nature of the transitions in the absorption spectra for the trimers, and the results are summarized in Table 7.

Their photophysical properties have been investigated in detail, with particular emphasis on probing the charge transfer character of the singlet excited state. The substitution of fluorene by carbazole red-shifts the emission from deep blue to sky blue. For the arylamine analogues the emission is further redshifted into the green region. We have also investigated the effect of conjugation between the donor and acceptor units and demonstrated that the para versus meta conjugation between the successive phenyl rings controls the properties having a strong effect on the ICT character and emission yield of the singlet excited state. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for exploiting ICT states in ambipolar oligomers to tune the emission across the deep blue—green spectral region while retaining moderate to high photoluminescence quantum yields. Furthermore, a number of these oligomers have the potential to be developed into polymers for use as emissive materials in optoelectronic devices. The high stability of fluorene, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide derivatives is very attractive in this regard.\n\n# Experimental Section\n\nGeneral Procedure: Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling. 3,7-Dibromodibenzothiophene S,SS , SS,S -dioxide (6) or 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (10) (1 equiv) and the boronic acid derivative 5, 14, or 16 (2.2 equiv) were dissolved in 1,4- dioxane or toluene.

The systems exhibit intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) states (of variable ICT character strengths) leading to fluorescence emission ranging from deep blue to green with moderate to high photoluminescence quantum yields. The emission properties can be effectively tuned by systematically changing the position of substitution on both donor and acceptor units (which affects the extent of conjugation) and the redox potentials of the donor units. The results are supported by cyclic voltammetric data and TD-DFT calculations.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe development of conjugated organic materials for optoelectronic devices remains a key objective across many disciplines of science.1 These materials have applications in organic/polymeric light-emitting diodes (O/PLEDs),2 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),3 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),4 electrochromism, and sensors.6 Studies on π\\\\piπ conjugated oligomers provide valuable insights into relevant fundamental properties.7\n\nThe covalent combination of electron donor and electron acceptor units has provided a wealth of information about energy and charge transfer processes.8 For example, the luminescence of 9,9-dialkylfluorene copolymers9 can be tuned over a large wavelength range by utilizing intramolecular\n\n# JOC Article\n\nCHaRT 1\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/995ed7361bc960f79feb22e8e26d8e0b7a01cef2662109b9e9474d28a058be3b.jpg)\n\ncharge and energy transfer processes both in solution and in the solid state.10 Oligo-/polycarbazoles are also a benchmark family of materials which are widely used for O/PLEDs, OFETs, and OPVs.11 They are predominantly hole transporters (p type) with reversible redox properties, strong luminescence, and a larger band gap than for polyfluorenes. Similarly, arylamines are well documented, mainly due to their high holetransporting ability.12 Many optoelectronic applications require ambipolar compounds: i.e., those able to accept, transport, or store both holes and electrons.1315 Intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) processes16 often play an important role in the photophysics of ambipolar systems. For example, Kulkarni et al. demonstrated an increase in ICT emission upon increasing the strength of the donor unit, comparing N.N .N. -methylcarbazole with the stronger donor N.N .N. -methylphenothiazine in acceptor— donor—acceptor trimers (acceptor \\=\\=\\= phenylquinoline).17Estrada and Neckers studied fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile derivatives as strong acceptors, linked through the 2,7- or 3,6-positions via alkyne bridges to carbazole donors to provide donor— acceptor—donor triads.18 Effective electronic communication was observed through the 3,6-positions to the fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile core. However, in contrast with the donor— acceptor—donor systems described in the present article, the ICT state in these fluoren-9-ylidene malononitrile derivatives was a nonradiative deactivation pathway (i.e., nonemissive), with one of the 3,6-disubstituted oligomers showing total emission quenching in polar solvents.\n\nOur group19 and other workers20 have incorporated dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (S) as an electron-deficient comonomer unit in oligo-/polyfluorene (F) backbones, e.g. trimer 119a\\\\mathbf { 1 } ^ { 1 9 \\\\mathrm { a } }119a and polymer 219d2 ^ { \\\\mathrm { 1 9 d } }219d (Chart 1), which show high luminescence efficiency.

Thus, the fluorene-containing trimers exhibit deep blue fluorescence which becomes sky blue for the carbazole analogues and green for the arylamine analogues (see Figure SI2-8 in the Supporting Information for a photograph showing the emission colors of compounds 1, 8, and 23). The TPA-based trimer 26 emits at the longest wavelength of all the compounds in this study (in both toluene and chloroform), consistent with the stronger donor enhancing the red shift.\n\nAll the oligomers show positive solvatochromism in their photoluminescence (PL) spectra due to ICT behavior, which enables the emission color to be tuned by varying the solvent polarity. Table 2 shows the absorption and emission data in both toluene and chloroform for all compounds. Compounds 20 and 21 are distinct in that they are bonded directly through the carbazole N atom rather than via one of the ring carbons and are considerably less soluble than the other trimers discussed here.\n\nTable 3 gives the Stokes and solvatochromic shift energies. There appear to be two distinct groups in this study based on the ICT character of these trimers. Trimers with relatively strong ICT may be defined by\n\n(i) a lack of fine structure emission in toluene (only one band value given in Table 2)  \n(ii) a large positive solvatochromic shift in the emission band on changing from toluene to chloroform (\\>1000 cm−1( > 1 0 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 }(\\>1000 cm−1 in Table 3)  \n(iii) a significantly positive solvatochromatic shift in the low-energy absorption maximum from toluene to chloroform (\\>400 c^m−1( { > } 4 0 0 \\\\ \\\\mathrm { \\\\hat { c } m } ^ { - 1 }(\\>400 c^m−1 in Table 3)  \n(iv) larger Stokes shifts (5000−6000 cm−1,( 5 0 0 0 { - } 6 0 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { c m } ^ { - 1 } ,(5000−6000 cm−1, in both toluene and chloroform\n\nTrimers with relatively weak ICT character may, therefore, be defined by\n\n(i) the presence of fine structure emission in toluene (two band values given in Table 2)\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/6ffec8df1de70ef541a08e508942c77315f96ccfbefe901c147676990eb7310f.jpg)  \nSCHEME 5.

The linear compounds containing DPA and TPA units (23 and 26, respectively) are between. The CT strength may be measured by comparing the emission peak maxima in different solvents: compound 11 represents strong ICT character, whereas the previously reported compound 1 is representative of weak ICT character (for details of the solvatochromism of 1 see ref 19b). Solvatochromic effects were studied in detail for compound 11, and Figure 2 shows the emission spectra in eight solvents of different polarities (see Figure SI2-19 for the corresponding absorption spectra). Figure 3 depicts the emission colors of 11 in four solvents.\n\nFor compound 11 spectral shifts due to solvent polarity are seen in both the absorption and emission spectra, with a profound effect seen in the emission. The emission spectra are red-shifted and broadened as the solvent polarity increases (from MCH to methanol), typical of ICT excited as. can be seen in MCH but disappears as the solvent polarity increases, again indicative of an excited ICT state.26\n\nBy plotting the wavelengths of the emission maxima of 11 in the different solvents as a function of the solvent orientation polarizability, Δf\\=(ε−1)/(2ε+1)−1/2((n2−1)/(2n2+1))\\\\Delta f = ( \\\\varepsilon - 1 ) / ( 2 \\\\varepsilon + 1 ) - 1 / 2 ( ( n ^ { 2 } - 1 ) / ( 2 n ^ { 2 } + 1 ) )Δf\\=(ε−1)/(2ε+1)−1/2((n2−1)/(2n2+1)) (LppMat eutn), thdit plt is obtained (Figure 4). It can be seen from this plot that the spectral shift of the emission follows (to a good approximation) a linear trend. Polar aprotic solvents such as dichloromethane and acetonitrile which are included in this plot indicate that the spectral shift is the result of solvent polarity and is not due to hydrogen bonding. Figure 4 also shows the Lippert plot of 1 for comparison (data taken from ref 19b). The slope of the Lippert plots of both 1 and 11 suggests, as can be seen from the Lippert— Mataga equation, that the excited-state dipole moment is larger than the ground-state dipole moment, which is also confirmed by the transient spectral shift to lower energies, observed in polar media from time-resolved data (as discussed in ref 19b). Especially for 11 the slope is much steeper, which, assuming that the cavity radii are similar for both compounds, yields a much larger difference between the dipole moments of the excited and ground states. This suggests a large charge separation for 11 in the excited state, which is also compatible with the frontier orbital picture obtained through DFT calculations (vide infra, Figure 8).\n\nTABLE 2.

Lippert plots for 1 and 11.\n\nChanging the position of the donor substituents on the S unit significantly affects the absorption and emission spectra. For 11 (2,8-disubstitution: bent) compared to isomer 8 (3,7-disubstitution: linear), the emission is blue-shifted (Figure 5). This can be explained by extended conjugative (para) effects in 8 where four rings are in conjugation, whereas in 11 only two rings are in conjugation. This effect is also seen in the analogous F−S\\\\mathbf { F } { - } \\\\mathbf { S }F−S systems 1 and 18. However, the bent vs linear effects of the N.N .N. -carbazole groups on the emission maxima in 20 and 21 (Figure 6) are much smaller, implying that less conjugation is taking place between the carbazolyl groups and the S unit in the linear isomer.\n\nAnalogous 2,8-disubstituted (bent) S units with both DPA and TPA substituents (without butyl chains) have been previously reported;22 they exhibit blue-shifted emission in toluene compared with 23 and 26, indicating similar bent vs linear effects. A similar effect was reported by Estrada and Neckers for trimers with the fluoren-9-ylidene malonitrile acceptor at the core: for the linear trimer the HOMO was delocalized, whereas for the bent isomer the HOMO was predominantly localized on the donor units.18\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/aa1975136061c9a5e12ff01fe20646d93121d6317c1805a44afc222d119f302f.jpg)  \nFIGURE 5.

The average lifetime was calculated from the expression30 τav\\=∑iAiτi2/∑iAiτi,\\\\begin{array} { r } { \\\\tau \\_ { \\\\mathrm { a v } } = \\\\sum \\_ { i } A \\_ { i } \\\\tau \\_ { i } ^ { 2 } / \\\\sum \\_ { i } A \\_ { i } \\\\tau \\_ { i } , } \\\\end{array}τav​\\=∑i​Ai​τi2​/∑i​Ai​τi​,​ where aia \\_ { i }ai​ and τi\\\\tau \\_ { i }τi​ are the amplitude and time constant of each exponential, respectively, and τav\\\\tau \\_ { \\\\mathrm { a v } }τav​ is the average lifetime. For all toluene solutions, except for 1 (see the previous discussion for this compound),19c both components have positive amplitudes with the fast components having time constants in the range of hundreds of picoseconds and the slower components having time constants in the range of nanoseconds.\n\nThe pre-exponential amplitude associated with the faster component is always small, and the weight of this decay component is always below 2%2 \\\\%2% , in agreement with the very small transient spectral relaxation observed in toluene, a low-polarity solvent. For compound 11, and also for compound 1,19b aditional time-resolved measurements were performed in ethanol, which is a solvent of high polarity (Figure 7). The decays collected in the high-energy region of the spectrum could be fitted with two exponential components with positive amplitudes. One component appears as a fast decay with a time constant of 28 ps2 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { p s }28 ps ,while the slower component has a time constant of 3.98 ns3 . 9 8 \\\\mathrm { \\\\ n s }3.98 ns The decays collected in the low-energy part of the spectrum could be fitted again with two exponential components. However, the amplitude of the fast one is now negative and its time constant is 23 ps, which correlates well with the time constant of the corresponding fast component of the high-energy region of the spectrum. The latter observation is a good indication that these components are due to the excited-state reorganization, controlled by solvent and molecular rearrangements, as observed for compound 1.19b The time constant of the slow component (3.93 ns) is also in excellent agreement with the corresponding one in the high-energy region of the spectrum. This indicates that the slow component is associated with the lifetime of the ICT state of this compound (11) in ethanol.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/fe49975cf665694939396c59e7d62ab4af4bd583c220cb3f332cebad1a608af4.jpg)  \nFIGURE 7.

Similar conclusions are found for the linear/bent pair, 1a and 18a. A slightly different scenario occurs for 20a and 21a, where the HOMO and LUMO compositions are similar in both cases and are essentially localized (Figure 9).

Figure 10 shows reasonable correlations between observed and computed values for both absorption and emission data, where absolute values of observed and computed data are typically different.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nDonor-acceptor-donor S-based oligomers have been synthesized where the donor strength has been increased in the series fluorene carbazole arylamine. Their photophysical properties have been investigated in detail, with particular emphasis on probing the charge transfer character of the singlet excited state. The substitution of fluorene by carbazole red-shifts the emission from deep blue to sky blue. For the arylamine analogues the emission is further redshifted into the green region. We have also investigated the effect of conjugation between the donor and acceptor units and demonstrated that the para versus meta conjugation between the successive phenyl rings controls the properties having a strong effect on the ICT character and emission yield of the singlet excited state. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for exploiting ICT states in ambipolar oligomers to tune the emission across the deep blue—green spectral region while retaining moderate to high photoluminescence quantum yields. Furthermore, a number of these oligomers have the potential to be developed into polymers for use as emissive materials in optoelectronic devices. The high stability of fluorene, carbazole, and dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide derivatives is very attractive in this regard.\n\n# Experimental Section\n\nGeneral Procedure: Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling. 3,7-Dibromodibenzothiophene S,SS , SS,S -dioxide (6) or 2,8-dibromodibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (10) (1 equiv) and the boronic acid derivative 5, 14, or 16 (2.2 equiv) were dissolved in 1,4- dioxane or toluene. The solution was degassed by bubbling argon through it for 15 min1 5 \\\\ \\\\mathrm { m i n }15 min .Dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium(II) (3−5  mol  %)( 3 - 5 \\\\mathrm { ~ \\\\ m o l ~ ~ } \\\\% )(3−5  mol  %) or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)- palladium(0) 5 mol%5 \\\\mathrm { \\\\ m o l \\\\% }5 mol% ) was added and the solution degassed further.

After removal of the solvent under vacuum, the residue was purified by column chromatography to obtain the product.\n\nAcknowledgment.
