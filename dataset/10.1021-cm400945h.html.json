However, for realizing blue-violet or violet emission the π\\\\piπ conjugation of organic molecules must be strictly confined. This will then either cause co-instantaneous decrease of fluorescent quantum yield and charge-transporting ability, or to some extent increase the synthetic difficulty when large molecular weight and/or bulky structure are usually required for good thermal and morphological stability. Very recently, donor- π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ acceptor (D-π- A) type fluorophores have attracted much attention because they not only show high fluorescent quantum yields owing to the effective radiative decay of their excited intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state but also possess impressive bipolar charge-transporting properties for their constituting hole- and electron-transporting moieties.1° As a result, the use of D--A type fluorophores can effectively simplify the device configrations 10a,f,e,g^ { 1 0 \\\\mathrm { a } , \\\\mathbf { f } , \\\\mathrm { e } , \\\\mathrm { g } }10a,f,e,g cence (EL) efficiencies of OLEDs.1 However, except for the enlarged π\\\\piπ conjugation, the ICT trend in such molecules indeed could also lead to remarkable fluorescence red shifts.10c\n\nBasing on a central A group of phosphine oxide that can break the local π\\\\piπ conjugation, Liu et al. recently developed a series of efficient deep-blue emitters which show electroluminescence CIE coordinates around (0.15, 0.10).10 Whereas room for further blue-shifting the emission still remains because the strong electron-donating NNN phenylnaphthalen-1-aminegroup (with relatively low oxidation potentials)10 and long π\\\\piπ bridges between the D and A units (3 to 4 benzene rings) were used in these emitters. Once replaced by other less electron-rich donors and shorter π\\\\piπ bridges, respectively, to limit the ICT trend and the molecular conjugation, the light emission can be further adjusted to shorter wavelength. Moss et al. systematically studied the photophysics of a series of electron-accepting dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (DBTO)-based fluorophores whic are modified with different kinds of D units.1 Among them, the carbazole/DBTO-connected fluorophores exhibit blue to violet (450 to 408 nm4 0 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }408 nm )fluorescence in toluene solution. Their fluorescent quantum yields are yet either moderate (0.58) or even low (0.25). It is also noticeable that substantial conjugation exists across the DBTO unit, still leaving the chance for further blue-shifting the emission. Thereby, the key point for designing high-efficiency blue-violet to violet electroluminescence materials is to suitably control the π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ conjugation enlargement and the ICT trend inside the molecules.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/7bdbc5d01b43ddd08cac674f0c63e55d3b3bc72266094c1bd20a9caf92b17627.jpg)  \nScheme 1. Synthesis of Czs1\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { s } \\\\mathbf { 1 }Czs1 and CzS2\n\nHerein, we utilized a carbazole/sulfone hybrid design strategy to obtain two novel efficient blue-violet fluorophores, di(4-(4-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)phenyl)sulfone (CzS1)\\\\mathbf { ( C z S 1 ) }(CzS1) and di(4- (9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)phenyl)sulfone (CzS2)\\\\mathbf { ( C z S 2 ) }(CzS2) (Scheme 1). The widely used hole-transporting moiety, carbazole, was selected as the electron-donor (D) for its relatively mild electron-donating ability as compared to other arylamines.10c These D--A type molecules could thus have relatively weak ICT trends, which is beneficial for generating short-wavelength emissions. Besides, the sulfone group was chosen as the electron-acceptor (A) for its excellent electron injection/ as linked to two freely rotatable benzene rings in this work, can also serve as a π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ conjugation breaker because of its tetrahedral electronic conformation which could effectively confine the π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ . conjugation of the molecules. Finally, these compounds were designed to be bulky to enhance their morphological and thermal stability by using a symmetrical D. π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ A π\\\\piπ D structure. Bipolar charge-transporting characteristics of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 were demonstrated with single-carrier type devices. Nondoped OLEDs based on the two novel fluorophores show blue-violet light emissions with CIEx,y\\\\mathrm { C I E } \\_ { \\\\mathrm { x , y } }CIEx,y​ of (0.157, 0.055) and (0.157, 0.044), respectively. The CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 -based device exhibited excellent EL performance with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.2%4 . 2 \\\\%4.2% ,current efficiency (CE) of 1.89 cd A−1\\\\mathbf { A } ^ { - 1 }A−1 ,and power efficiency (PE) of 1.58lmW−11 . 5 8 \\\\mathrm { l m } \\\\mathrm { W } ^ { - 1 }1.58lmW−1 Performances of the devices are among the best of OLEDs with CIEy\\\\mathrm { C I E } \\_ { y }CIEy​ below 0.06.

In the absorption spectra of 30 nm3 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { { n m } }30 nm thick films, the two compounds show similar absorptions where the bands around 345 and 300  nm3 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { ~ n m }300  nm can be respectively attributed to the ICT transition and the carbazole-centered n−π∗\\\\mathrm { n } \\\\mathrm { - } \\\\pi ^ { \\\\ast }n−π∗ transition. These absorption bands slightly blue-shift in toluene solution while another distinct shoulder band at 332 nm was found for CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 . This may arise from the π−π∗\\\\pi - \\\\pi ^ { \\* }π−π∗ transition in the donor units. From the film onset absorptions, both of the band gaps (Eg)( E \\_ { \\\\mathrm { g } } )(Eg​) of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 are determined to be 3.16 eV.3 . 1 6 ~ \\\\mathrm { e V } .3.16 eV. In the film PL spectra, CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 exhibits a narrow emission around 428 nm4 2 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }428 nm with a fwhm (full width at halfmaximum) of 56nm,5 6 \\\\mathrm { n m } ,56nm, while CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 shows a relatively blue-shifted emission at 416 nm4 1 6 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }416 nm with a fwhm of 51 nm5 1 ~ \\\\mathrm { { n m } }51 nm Therefore, the film fluorescent emissions of both compounds are located in the short-wavelength spectral region of the whole visible light spectrum. To illustrate the reasonable molecular design in this work, we may also compare their solution PL characteristics with compound 11, namely, 2,8-di( N⋅N \\\\cdotN⋅ (2-ethylhexyl)-carbazol3-yl) dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide, which has the highestenergy fluorescence of 408 nm4 0 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }408 nm in toluene among its carbazole/ DBTO analogues reported by Moss et al.11 In our case, both of the new compounds give violet fluorescence with maximum wavelengths below 400 nm4 0 0 \\\\ \\\\mathrm { n m }400 nm in the same solution. The higher energy fluorescence of our compounds should be primarily ascribed to the reasonable molecular design using conjugationlimited diphenylsulfone block instead of the planar DBTO unit. The ICT characteristics of the two emitters are shown via their gradually red-shifted and broadened fluorescent emissions upon increasing the polarity of solvent (Figure 3). Large increase of the dipole moment from the ground state to the excited state was also calculated from the Lippert—Mataga calculation, 37 D for CzS1\\\\mathbf { C z S 1 }CzS1 and 24 D2 4 ~ \\\\mathrm { D }24 D for CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 (see Supporting Information), 15 further reflecting the typical photoinduced ICT process and the effective electronic communication between the donor and acceptor units. In addition, fluorescent quantum yields of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 were estimated to be approaching unity in toluene, as referenced to quinine sulfate Φf\\=0.56\\\\Phi \\_ { \\\\mathrm { f } } = 0 . 5 6Φf​\\=0.56 in 1NH2SO4,\\\\mathrm { 1 N H \\_ { 2 } S O \\_ { 4 } } ,1NH2​SO4​, .16 Such high quantum yields (four times over that of compound 11, 0.25) are owing to the suitably modified D. π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ Amolecular structures which could provide highly emissive ICT excited states upon excitation. Even in neat films, these yields still remain impressively high as measured by the integrating sphere method under air condition, 0.98 for CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and 0.79 for CzS2, suggesting that the fluorescence quenching routes in the film have been effectively suppressed, probably owing to the bulky D. π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ A π\\\\piπ D structures.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/6ec43f7d0c99e3140688363dd0067305e4c0fd6dfea425c954355c5e4ba8dc41.jpg)  \nFigure 2.

Supporting Information, Figure S2 shows their room-temperature transient PL decay characteristics in an oxygen-free toluene solution. The samples were freshly nitrogen-purged to avoid any possible triplet quenching by oxygen. It is interesting to find that, in contrast to the case of compound 3 in the report of Adachi et al., both of our new compounds clearly exhibit first-order exponential decays which completely end within a short time range of 20 ns2 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { n s }20 ns Indeed, no delayed components were observed in both cases, indicating the absence of DATF emission from CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 We may mainly attribute this to the overwhelming emission transition rate over the nonemission transition rate of their photoinduced excited states. As mentioned above, CzS1 and CzS2 achieved near-unity fluorescent quantum yields even in the airequilibrated toluene solution, and therefore one can deduce that the intersystem crossing (ISC) process, one non-emission\n\nTable 1.

On the other hand, as delayed fluorescence is established by the premise of converting the triplet back to a singlet state, the energy distance (ΔEsT)( \\\\Delta E \\_ { \\\\mathrm { { s T } } } )(ΔEsT​) between the lowest singlet state and the lowest triplet state should be taken into account; generally, the smaller ΔEST\\\\Delta E \\_ { \\\\mathrm { S T } }ΔEST​ the more efficient the upconversion.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted to measure the HOMO levels of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 .From the onset of the oxidation curves (Figure 4), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels were estimated to be −5.61\\- 5 . 6 1−5.61 and −5.62  eV\\- 5 . 6 2 \\\\mathrm { ~ \\\\ e V }−5.62  eV for CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 respectively, by comparing with ferrocene (Fc) Γ(HOMO \\=\\\\mathrm { \\\\Gamma ( H O M O \\\\ = }Γ(HOMO \\= −(Eˉox+4.8) eVˉ,\\- ( \\\\mathrm { \\\\bar { \\\\it E } \\_ { o x } } + 4 . 8 ) ~ \\\\mathrm { e \\\\bar { V } } ,−(Eˉox​+4.8) eVˉ, .18 Their LUMO levels were further estimated by summing the HOMO levels and the band gaps determined from their absorption edges. These orbital energy levels are listed in Table 1. The similarity of molecular orbital energy levels should be associated with the fact that these molecules incorporate identical functional groups and similar D--A structures. To gain insight into the electronic structures of these compounds, a density functional theory (DFT) calculation was performed at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level. Figure 5 reveals an obvious separation of the HOMO and the LUMO which are dominantly located on the carbazole and the diphenylsulfone units respectively. This separation should effectively maintain the individual electronic properties of these functional groups an ben anport boh ho n lecons.In addition, it can also be observed that there are still enough HOMO-LUMO overlaps. These are required to guarantee effective electronic communication between the donor and the acceptor, and thus highly emissive ICT excited states which have already been demonstrated by the high fluorescent quantum yields. 20\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/131e2eaca2f5ff12a3ecfc0b3164a8fab3c810d3f3863fe2b6f8de56ffe4612d.jpg)  \nFigure 4.

The EL spectra are almost identical to the corresponding PL spectra of their neat films and show little change under different driving voltages.

Additionally, it is also found that the hole and electron currents of the CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 devices are both much higher, however, less balanced as compared to those of the CzS1 devices.

However, for realizing blue-violet or violet emission the π\\\\piπ conjugation of organic molecules must be strictly confined. This will then either cause co-instantaneous decrease of fluorescent quantum yield and charge-transporting ability, or to some extent increase the synthetic difficulty when large molecular weight and/or bulky structure are usually required for good thermal and morphological stability. Very recently, donor- π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ acceptor (D-π- A) type fluorophores have attracted much attention because they not only show high fluorescent quantum yields owing to the effective radiative decay of their excited intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state but also possess impressive bipolar charge-transporting properties for their constituting hole- and electron-transporting moieties.1° As a result, the use of D--A type fluorophores can effectively simplify the device configrations 10a,f,e,g^ { 1 0 \\\\mathrm { a } , \\\\mathbf { f } , \\\\mathrm { e } , \\\\mathrm { g } }10a,f,e,g cence (EL) efficiencies of OLEDs.1 However, except for the enlarged π\\\\piπ conjugation, the ICT trend in such molecules indeed could also lead to remarkable fluorescence red shifts.10c\n\nBasing on a central A group of phosphine oxide that can break the local π\\\\piπ conjugation, Liu et al. recently developed a series of efficient deep-blue emitters which show electroluminescence CIE coordinates around (0.15, 0.10).10 Whereas room for further blue-shifting the emission still remains because the strong electron-donating NNN phenylnaphthalen-1-aminegroup (with relatively low oxidation potentials)10 and long π\\\\piπ bridges between the D and A units (3 to 4 benzene rings) were used in these emitters. Once replaced by other less electron-rich donors and shorter π\\\\piπ bridges, respectively, to limit the ICT trend and the molecular conjugation, the light emission can be further adjusted to shorter wavelength. Moss et al. systematically studied the photophysics of a series of electron-accepting dibenzothiophene S,S-dioxide (DBTO)-based fluorophores whic are modified with different kinds of D units.1 Among them, the carbazole/DBTO-connected fluorophores exhibit blue to violet (450 to 408 nm4 0 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }408 nm )fluorescence in tolu",

Their fluorescent quantum yields are yet either moderate (0.58) or even low (0.25). It is also noticeable that substantial conjugation exists across the DBTO unit, still leaving the chance for further blue-shifting the emission. Thereby, the key point for designing high-efficiency blue-violet to violet electroluminescence materials is to suitably control the π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ conjugation enlargement and the ICT trend inside the molecules.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/7bdbc5d01b43ddd08cac674f0c63e55d3b3bc72266094c1bd20a9caf92b17627.jpg)  \nScheme 1.

The widely used hole-transporting moiety, carbazole, was selected as the electron-donor (D) for its relatively mild electron-donating ability as compared to other arylamines.10c These D--A type molecules could thus have relatively weak ICT trends, which is beneficial for generating short-wavelength emissions. Besides, the sulfone group was chosen as the electron-acceptor (A) for its excellent electron injection/ as linked to two freely rotatable benzene rings in this work, can also serve as a π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ conjugation breaker because of its tetrahedral electronic conformation which could effectively confine the π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ . conjugation of the molecules.

CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 were similarly prepared through three synthetic steps (Scheme 1) of good yields. Diphenylsulfide was first subjected to the substitution of Br2\\\\mathrm { B r } \\_ { 2 }Br2​ 13 The Br2\\\\mathrm { B r } \\_ { 2 }Br2​ could be rapidly reproduced by H2O2\\\\mathrm { H } \\_ { 2 } \\\\mathrm { O } \\_ { 2 }H2​O2​ in the two-phase system of CH2Cl2/H2O\\\\mathrm { C H } \\_ { 2 } \\\\mathrm { C l } \\_ { 2 } / \\\\mathrm { H } \\_ { 2 } \\\\mathrm { O }CH2​Cl2​/H2​O which significantly promotes the reaction.

Finally, palladium(0)-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between 4-(carbazol-9-yl)phenylboronic acid/(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)- boronic acid and di(4-bromophenyl)sulfone resulted in the target compounds, CzS1/CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 } / \\\\mathrm { C z S 2 }CzS1/CzS2 . These new compounds were characterized with mass spectrometry, 1H^ 1 \\\\mathrm { H }1H NMR, 13C^ { 1 3 } \\\\mathrm { C }13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis.\n\nThermal Properties.

Photophysical properties of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 were analyzed using ultraviolet—visible (UV-vis) and photoluminescence (PL) spectrometers. The data are shown in Figure 2, 3 and Table 1. In the absorption spectra of 30 nm3 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { { n m } }30 nm thick films, the two compounds show similar absorptions where the bands around 345 and 300  nm3 0 0 ~ \\\\mathrm { ~ n m }300  nm can be respectively attributed to the ICT transition and the carbazole-centered n−π∗\\\\mathrm { n } \\\\mathrm { - } \\\\pi ^ { \\\\ast }n−π∗ transition. These absorption bands slightly blue-shift in toluene solution while another distinct shoulder band at 332 nm was found for CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 . This may arise from the π−π∗\\\\pi - \\\\pi ^ { \\* }π−π∗ transition in the donor units. From the film onset absorptions, both of the band gaps (Eg)( E \\_ { \\\\mathrm { g } } )(Eg​) of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 are determined to be 3.16 eV.3 . 1 6 ~ \\\\mathrm { e V } .3.16 eV. In the film PL spectra, CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 exhibits a narrow emission around 428 nm4 2 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }428 nm with a fwhm (full width at halfmaximum) of 56nm,5 6 \\\\mathrm { n m } ,56nm, while CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 shows a relatively blue-shifted emission at 416 nm4 1 6 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }416 nm with a fwhm of 51 nm5 1 ~ \\\\mathrm { { n m } }51 nm Therefore, the film fluorescent emissions of both compounds are located in the short-wavelength spectral region of the whole visible light spectrum. To illustrate the reasonable molecular design in this work, we may also compare their solution PL characteristics with compound 11, namely, 2,8-di( N⋅N \\\\cdotN⋅ (2-ethylhexyl)-carbazol3-yl) dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide, which has the highestenergy fluorescence of 408 nm4 0 8 ~ \\\\mathrm { n m }408 nm in toluene among its carbazole/ DBTO analogues reported by Moss et al.11 In our case, both of the new compounds give violet fluorescence with maximum wavelengths below 400 nm4 0 0 \\\\ \\\\mathrm { n m }400 nm in the same solution. The higher energy fluorescence of our compounds should be primarily ascribed to the reasonable molecular design using conjugationlimited diphenylsulfone block instead of the planar DBTO unit. The ICT characteristics of the two emitters are shown via their gradually red-shifted and broadened fluorescent emissions upon increasing the polarity of solvent (Figure 3). Large increase of the dipole moment from the ground state to the excited state was also calculated from the Lippert—Mataga calculation, 37 D for CzS1\\\\mathbf { C z S 1 }CzS1 and 24 D2 4 ~ \\\\mathrm { D }24 D for CzS2\\\\mathrm { C z } \\\\mathrm { S } 2CzS2 (see Supporting Information), 15 further reflecting the typical photoinduced ICT process and the effective electronic communication between the donor and acceptor units. In addition, fluorescent quantum yields of CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and CzS2\\\\mathbf { C } \\\\mathbf { z } \\\\mathbf { S } 2CzS2 were estimated to be approaching unity in toluene, as referenced to quinine sulfate Φf\\=0.56\\\\Phi \\_ { \\\\mathrm { f } } = 0 . 5 6Φf​\\=0.56 in 1NH2SO4,\\\\mathrm { 1 N H \\_ { 2 } S O \\_ { 4 } } ,1NH2​SO4​, .16 Such high quantum yields (four times over that of compound 11, 0.25) are owing to the suitably modified D. π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ Amolecular structures which could provide highly emissive ICT excited states upon excitation. Even in neat films, these yields still remain impressively high as measured by the integrating sphere method under air condition, 0.98 for CzS1\\\\mathrm { C z S 1 }CzS1 and 0.79 for CzS2, suggesting that the fluorescence quenching routes in the film have been effectively suppressed, probably owing to the bulky D. π⋅\\\\pi \\\\cdotπ⋅ A π\\\\piπ D structures.\n\n![](https://storage.treer.ai/images/6ec43f7d0c99e3140688363dd0067305e4c0fd6dfea425c954355c5e4ba8dc41.jpg)  \nFigure 2.

      "summary": "Two D–π–A fluorophores, CzS1 and CzS2 (carbazole donor, sulfone acceptor), were developed. Nondoped devices emit at CIE (0.157,0.055) and (0.157,0.044). Figure 8 shows J–V–L, efficiency and EQE plots; Figure 9 shows single‑carrier J–V: CzS2 has higher, less balanced currents. CzS1: EQE 4.2%, CE 1.89 cd A−1, PE 1.58 lm W−1."
