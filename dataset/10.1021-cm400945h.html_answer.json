  "question": "Give a list of label\tAbsorption max (nm)\tEmission max (nm)\tLifetime (ns)\tQuantum yield for the compounds mentioned in the document.",
  "answer": "Plan:\n- Search the document for “absorption,” “emission,” “quantum yield,” and “lifetime/ns.”\n- Locate any summary table(s) with photophysical data and extract values.\n\nWhat I found:\n- A photophysical summary table (Table 1) lists absorption/emission maxima (solution and film), fluorescence lifetimes, and quantum yields for CzS1 and CzS2.\n- Supporting text confirms film PL peaks and measurement methods.\n\nExtracted data (from Table 1 and surrounding text):\n- Source: Table 1 image (photophysical properties) and UV–vis/PL discussion\n  - Table 1 image: https://storage.treer.ai/images/66bf1cd031ef7e2656a7b3be784695c67fe0f27612f303633ae6848f89720663.jpg\n  - UV–vis/PL discussion: absorption/emission in films (chars 21000–22500)\n  - Transient decay context (solution, oxygen-free toluene): chars 25850–26650\n\nList of compounds with absorption max (nm), emission max (nm), lifetime (ns), and quantum yield:\n- CzS1\n  - Absorption max (nm): solution 293, 332, 341; film 293, 346 [Table 1; UV–vis/PL text]\n  - Emission max (nm): solution 399; film 428 [Table 1; UV–vis/PL text]\n  - Lifetime (ns): 2.55 (measured for solution; transient decays recorded in oxygen-free toluene) [Table 1; transient decay text]\n  - Quantum yield: solution ≈1; film 0.98 [Table 1]\n- CzS2\n  - Absorption max (nm): solution 300, 332; film 304, 347 [Table 1; UV–vis/PL text]\n  - Emission max (nm): solution 381, 392; film 416 [Table 1; UV–vis/PL text]\n  - Lifetime (ns): 1.51 (measured for solution; transient decays recorded in oxygen-free toluene) [Table 1; transient decay text]\n  - Quantum yield: solution ≈1; film 0.79 [Table 1]\n\nNotes:\n- Table 1 uses superscripts: a = solution; c = film. τ (ns) is given once per compound and, per the experimental section and transient PL description, corresponds to solution (oxygen-free toluene).\n- Film PLQY was measured by integrating sphere; transient decays were characterized with an Edinburgh F900 setup."
