  "question": "Give a list of label\tAbsorption max (nm)\tEmission max (nm)\tLifetime (ns)\tQuantum yield for the compounds mentioned in the document.",
  "answer": "Plan and initial findings:\n- Searched the document for PLQY, absorption/emission data, and tables summarizing photophysics.\n- Located Figure 1 and “Table 1. Photophysical, Electrochemical and ASE Properties of BSBCz, BPBFCz1, and BPBFCz2 in Solution, 6 wt% doped CBP films, and Neat Films,” which contains the required absorption maxima, emission maxima, lifetimes, and quantum yields.\n\nExtracted values (from Table 1; solution values first as primary, with film values also included for completeness):\n\n- BSBCz\n  - Solution (toluene): Absorption max = 370 nm; Emission max = 420, 447 nm; Lifetime = 0.87 ns; Quantum yield = 0.89\n  - 6 wt% CBP film: Absorption max = 298, 331, 389 nm; Emission max = 438, 462 nm; Lifetime = 1.3 ns; Quantum yield = 0.98\n  - Neat film: Absorption max = 372 nm; Emission max = 480 nm; Lifetime = 1.6 ns; Quantum yield = 0.69\n\n- BPBFCz1\n  - Solution (toluene): Absorption max = 369 nm; Emission max = 419, 443 nm; Lifetime = 0.97 ns; Quantum yield = 0.96\n  - 6 wt% CBP film: Absorption max = 298, 331, 380 nm; Emission max = 441, 462 nm; Lifetime = 1.5 ns; Quantum yield = 1.00\n  - Neat film: Absorption max = 370 nm; Emission max = 484 nm; Lifetime = 2.2 ns; Quantum yield = 0.89\n\n- BPBFCz2\n  - Solution (toluene): Absorption max = 365 nm; Emission max = 407, 430 nm; Lifetime = 0.93 ns; Quantum yield = 0.93\n  - 6 wt% CBP film: Absorption max = 298, 331, 376 nm; Emission max = 419, 445 nm; Lifetime = 1.3 ns; Quantum yield = 1.00\n  - Neat film: Absorption max = 367 nm; Emission max = 427, 452 nm; Lifetime = 1.8 ns; Quantum yield = 0.87\n\nCitations:\n- Table 1 in the main text: “Photophysical, Electrochemical and ASE Properties of BSBCz, BPBFCz1, and BPBFCz2 in Solution, 6 wt% Doped CBP Films, and Neat Films.” Image link of the table in the document: https://storage.treer.ai/images/d1db42964d958b07a483d6fae5c69e28b0289b48889cf326b8de1b62593f7e4e.jpg\n- Figure 1b (UV–vis absorption and emission spectra in toluene) for visual confirmation: https://storage.treer.ai/images/9647f67ac125b67efc4453a13aae491d7699debe96261221f0a8ce90de5b51f0.jpg\n\nIf you prefer only the solution (toluene) values in the final list, let me know and I’ll provide just those."
